Hi Tony

There are the three things you need to do:
1. Implement error detection mechanism in global.cpp, declared in global.h;
      bool notCorrupted(unsigned short expectedChecksum, char* msg);
2. Finish reliable data transfer protocol, fill out the TODO sections in 
      sender.cpp and receiver.cpp.
3. Read channel.h carefully(because it's changed), and Ask any questions you have.

Do not change channel.h, channel.cpp. If you need to test out the
code, write small programs in test.cpp and compile with command:
"make test"

Sender only serves files in senderRoot, and receiver only puts files into receiverRoot.
We assume the user won't type ".." just as in project 1.

Here are some of my questions. Post all your questions in the following section:
--- START
1. Should sender be a daemon?
2. Timed wait?
3. Should host name only be IP address (dotted)?
--- END

parts not fully implemented
1. checksum for packet that only has header					#DONE
2. if the last FIN from receiver is lost, how long should I wait?       #DONE when sender time out 3 times then assume 
                                                                              receiver has finished file transimission
